The Data Link Layer (DLL) is the second layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, situated between the Physical and Network layers. It is responsible for reliable node-to-node delivery within the same local network. 
Core Functions
Framing: It divides packets from the Network layer into manageable units called frames. It adds headers (containing MAC addresses) and trailers (containing error-checking data) to define the beginning and end of each data unit.
Physical Addressing: It manages unique hardware addresses (MAC addresses) to ensure data reaches the correct physical device on a link.
Error Control: It detects and sometimes corrects errors that occur during physical transmission, typically using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) in the frame trailer.
Flow Control: It regulates the data transmission rate to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.
Access Control: It determines how multiple devices share a single physical communication medium to avoid collisions (e.g., CSMA/CD for Ethernet). 
Sub-Layers
The DLL is divided into two distinct sub-layers: 
Logical Link Control (LLC): Manages flow control, error checking, and frame synchronization.
Media Access Control (MAC): Controls how devices gain access to the physical media and handles physical addressing.
